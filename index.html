<h1><strong>The Winner Never Quits And The Quitter Never Wins</strong></h1>
<h2><mark>Journey To Success</mark></h2>

<p><strong>What is the literal meaning of "winners never quit, quitters never win"?</strong></p>
<p>is a common saying which reaches our ears at least once in a month</p>
<p>I will narrate a story which will make it absolutely clear for you. Here it goes……

    Once upon a time, there was a mentor who taught five princes. Whenever he asked them to do any work , they would begin it with great enthusiasm, but with time , it would become boring for them and they would stop doing it. One day the mentor thought of teaching them a lesson. He asked them to dig a well. As usual , they began it with great enthusiasm and when they had dug 10m deep , their mentor came and said,” This is not the right place to dig a well. Go somewhere else and dig.” The princes followed his command. They began digging again. When they had dug 15m deep, their mentor came again and asked them to dig somewhere else. The mentor repeated the same exercise several times. At last , when the princes could no more dig, they went to their mentor and said,” If we would have dug all those metres on the same spot , water would have started flowing already” Their mentor smiled and said,” That is what I wanted to teach you. If you never complete one work utterly and shift to the other just because it is difficult or seems boring , then you will never know its end i.e. , you would never win.”
    
    This is what the saying means…..</p>
